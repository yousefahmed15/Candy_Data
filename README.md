# Candy_Data
# I explored the data and the data was totally unclean So I began cleaning by:
> - Cleaning Going out column (where I replaced NaN values by random yes and no answers to be unbiased) <br><br>
> - Cleaning Gender column (where I replaced NaN values by I'd rather not to say as I considered that the person don't want to say his gender so he didn't answer) <br><br>
> - Cleaning age column (I removed outliers and I replaced NaN values by mean) <br><br>
> - Cleaning country column (I cleaned countries and removed wrong data) <br><br>
> - Now for Q6 (I made a point system which helped me to know what I want to know So I got best 5 candies and worst 5 candies) <br><br>
> - Then I cleanded column of dress (I replaced NaN values by random values) <br><br>
> - Then for day column (I replaced NaN values by random values) <br><br>

# Results I got:

> - Most people aren't going out <br><br>
> - The most gender is for males <br><br>
> - Mean age is 43 (before my dataset even more baised towards mean) <br><br>
> - Most people are from USA <br><br>
> - Most and least popular candies are in the table above <br><br>
> - Most people prefers Friday <br><br>
